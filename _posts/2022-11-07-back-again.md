Also my old Professor Farnsworth would say, 'Good news everyone!' After leaving an old instance of my blog up on DigitalOcean, I've finally migrated it over to LightSail seeing as how the Bitnami install for Ghost works better than it has in the past. LightSail is a little bit cheaper and I'll have a smaller footprint now, plus the worst case I can migrate this over to an EC2 instance. Downside is I gotta get another theme working, the installer isn't the latest and greatest along with the fact the upgrade process isn't stellar.

## Of what's been going on...

I guess a lot can happen in two years since updating this. Back in Texas for a bit is maybe the biggest plus a job change that may have been a misstep and the hope for an eventual house. Onto the fun stuff though!

### Certs!

Since the last update on here, I snagged the **AWS Solutions Architect Associate**, **Certified Terraform Associate**, **CompTIA Security+**, **CompTIA Pentest+** and **ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity**.

More recently I had the epiphany that if I want to get into the Security aspect of IT, I gotta stop waiting until I feel ready and jump in (or try to at least). So I've applied tons of places for both a cybersec job and regular cloud sec job, so who knows where I'll end up.

That's good enough for now, behind the scenes I spent too much time trying to get the embedded HTML to show the certs in proper order from a 3rd party verification site that ended up not working 100% how I wanted.

The quarantine continues as does the studying. I saw a coworker get an easy certification for Azure and after a quick talk with him it didn't sound to difficult so I decided to give it a shot as well. After a week and a half of studying, I was able to remotely take a certification test and pass!

Behold!

Sure, it wasn't especially difficult and it wasn't the [RHCSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Certification_Program) that I've (still) been studying but it is a minor achievement and should make my manager happy. I did get to learn a little bit more about the service which hopefully makes me a better 'Cloud Engineer' or what have you.

What's next? Well, I'm trying to ride the wave of motivation and get a proper AWS cert under my belt so we'll see how that goes. RHCSA is in the background, disappointedly looking at me asking, "But Matt, you've been studying me for the longest. When is it my turn?" Soon, well, eventually soon mr RHCSA. Good news is that Red Hat now allows remote exams with this ongoing pandemic so that's a bit of incentive, however the bad news is that it looks like it's the newer exam that I haven't completely studied for though a lot of the core material is still the same.

That's it, I'm sure I have more interesting news to give, but that's all for now.

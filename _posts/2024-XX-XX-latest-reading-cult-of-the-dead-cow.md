# What's this about a dead cow?

First off, Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc) is an early hacking group from an era when personal computers was a wholly new concept, when the "internet" was a place you went to rather than something you can no longer escape and smothers you in your daily life. 

> Still, they wanted to be taken seriously. And the name Pan-Galactic Entropy didn’t sound menacing enough to be cool. It was too Hitchhiker’s Guide nerdy. They kicked around possible new names for their effort to tie together their small community of bulletin boards and writing and decided that something with the word cult would be sinister and mysterious enough. Cult of what? Some words were too silly, like strawberry. But a little silly would be good. “We wanted it to be weird,” Brandon said. “Just trying to thumb our nose at the establishment.” This was a place with a clubhouse feel, the liberal arts section of the hacker underground. Kevin thought of a creepy hangout nearby, an abandoned slaughterhouse, the unpleasant hind part of the most iconic Texas industry. In that moment, he hit upon the name: the Cult of the Dead Cow.

## What the hell is it about?


I forget what lead me to snag a copy of the book on Kindle; perhaps while following the author on Twitter they mentioned it or maybe it was recommended based on some algorithm based on my past ebook purchases.

## Doesn't Hurt to Ask
Eons ago (or at least what feels like it) I read a book from an entrepreneur that I picked up at a school book fair. In the book, the author recounted their years growing up and different ways they made money creatively through the years. While I've forgotten almost everything about the book (except that it mentioned making money on Beanie Babies, if that gives you any idea how old it is) there was one story that talked about how they received an upgrade for a room by writing the CEO at the time and getting an upgrade later when they checked into the hotel. 

I gotta note that I hate the idea of going through life like one of those people who always says "it doesn't hurt to ask" and then ask for an upgrade on every single minor thin that crosses their mind, but sometimes when there's something you would really like to take a shot at, it really doesn't hurt to ask. (This is coming from someone who hates asking for help, asking a question or anything else you can think of. I'm the type to die choking in a restaurant than ask for help and somehow be noticed.)

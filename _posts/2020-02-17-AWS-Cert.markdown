Good news, I finally got a new cert that's relevant to my career. It's the AWS Cloud Practioner so it's pretty entry level but it is a step forward (and keeps my manager happy).

The next two goals for myself, certification wise anyway, is to get the RHCSA and then an associate level AWS certification in that order. While it would probably be smarter to continue learning the same subject (albeit more advanced) while it's fresh on the mind, the RHCSA exam is more interesting to me and I think has more practical knowledge that I can use depending on my next job. Not to mention I have a couple of servers running Linux at home that I can use to practice with for the exam... Which reminds me that I need to create another post talking about my homelab since I 86'd the old site... Which also reminds me that I need to keep working on this site as well. 

So what's kept me from working on the blog and actually updating it with some regularity as well as customizing it? A bit of a cascade of wanting to do X which requires (okay, doesn't require but saves time in the future) me to know how to do Y. So this blog for example works on a new platform rather than Wordpress like I've used in the past. So if I want to customize it I'd like to have a dev instance to tinker with and customize before transitioning the new design to my actual blog. Now there's two ways to do that, either startup another Ghost instance on DigitalOcean at a small cost of about 5 bucks a month or I can setup a test instance at home manually. That then requires a new VM or I can setup a Docker instance and use that. Except I don't know how to use Docker. But I do have a few good books from Manning.com on those books as well as my LinuxAcademy subscription. Then I need to probably upgrade the homelab and it goes on and on.

## In Other News...

I am working on a post or two about some basic online security as well as the answers to the Bandit OverTheWire 'war games'. Those will eventually be posted... one of these days.

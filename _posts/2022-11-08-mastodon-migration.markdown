With Twitter in flames courtesy of Elon's Musk, there's been a big migration away from Twitter toward [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/). I actually signed up a while ago there on a separate instance, but now there's [an infosec.exchange instance that I've moved to](https://infosec.exchange/@thewrightmatt).

So far I'm really enjoying it as it's much more of a niche community so far, but the nice thing is that everyone can have their space on their own servers, be it journalists, photographers, reporters and so on! If you find one of those instances, you can see who is local and follow them from your own instance.

I was looking at the local feed (just updates from people on the same server) and I very much got the 'old internet' vibe of people being friendly(ish), no ads or agendas being pushed, nothing to incite anger, etc. Almost reminds me of the old IRC days and when I had a new game that wouldn't work, someone in the GameSpy chat for the game helped me out.

There's still a learning curve, but here's to something new!

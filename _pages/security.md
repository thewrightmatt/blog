# Basic Online Security

## The "Too Long; Didn't Read" Bit
Use 2FA,
Use a password management tool (also with 2FA*)
Email forwarders


I replied to someone a while ago on Reddit asking how they should protect their online identities after one of their accounts was accessed by someone. I figure a write-up would help friends and family that stumble across my site (or if I'm lazy I can point them here if asked). The quick and dirty? Use a password manager, enable multi-factor auth where possible and check your email address against haveibeenpwned.com. So what the hell does that mean? Read on.

I'm by no means a security professional but I do try to follow best practices where possible and stay well read on the subject. I've tried to keep things simple for the most part so if you're well read on the topic of security and want to yell at me for suggesting SMS as an alternative to installing an authenticator app, I get that it's not great but certainly better than solely relying on a password. But this that said, if there's anything that would be detrimental to someone by all means let me know!

## Multifactor Authentication (MFA or 2FA)

Multifactor is exactly what it says is is, an additional authentication method when logging into a website. Ever get a text asking you to enter in a code from a website after you log in for the first time after a while? Bam, 2FA. It's not the best implementation ever, but it certainly should help make your account a little more secure.

Ideally it uses two methods of authentication - something you know (a password), something you have (OTP aka an app on your phone), something you are (a fingerprint) and so on. That way if your password gets stolen somehow, the second method of authentication should prevent any fraudulent attempts to access an account. It's typically a bad practice to use the same type of authentication twice (most usually something you know, using a password and then a 'What street did you grow up on.' Both are something you know plus 'What street did you grow up on' is a bad question to answer, more on that later)

'That's all great Matt, but how and where do I get started?' 

First thing's first, the site will need to have the option of enabling multifactor auth for your account. https://twofactorauth.org/

# Look...

I think having an "About Me" page is dumb, but it's built in to this template/platform so I'm creating this page so it doesn't give a 404 page when you click my name somewhere. Besides, this whole site is an 'About Me' in a way.

If I do put anything else here, it'll be stuff I find funny, which again would fill that 'About Me' gap.
